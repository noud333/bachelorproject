# Emission spectra
An emission spectrum looks at the 2nd transit of a exoplanet. The 2nd transit is the point where the planet moves behind the star. At this moment we can only observe the light of the star, instead of the light of the star and the planet.

We can use the difference between the normal light (star + planet) and the 2nd transit (star) to find the light that comes from the planet. 

### Eclipse depth
In the optimal case, we would like to look at the 2nd transmission in all wavelengths in which the star and exoplanet provide enough light to be found. This however is an unrealistic expectation, therefore to find the best spots we can look into eclipse depth.

The eclipse depth here shows, assuming blackbody radiation, the light emitted by the planet devided by the light emitted by the star. As both objects have different surface temperatures, the peaks of their blackbodies will be different. Therefore optimal zone to look at is the zone where the planets emission is relatively bigger than that of the star.

## JWST instruments
### NIRSpec
[NIRSpec disperser info](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-spectrograph/nirspec-instrumentation/nirspec-dispersers-and-filters)

The general range of NIRSpec is around 0.7 to 5.14 micrometer.

The NIRSpec is focussed on spectral imaging in, as the name suggests, the Near InfraRed. In this area it has 7 different light dispensers. These dispensers can be grouped in 3 different ways: low, medium and high spectral resolution. The prism is the low resolution method, after that there are 3 medium and 3 high resolution modes. These are differentiated by their first letter. This being either M or H. The modes are 140, 235, and 395 followed by M or H. 

For every dispenser there are a few filters that work with it. These can be found in [table 2](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-spectrograph/nirspec-instrumentation/nirspec-dispersers-and-filters) of this page. These combinations result in different wavelenght ranges in which they can be used. This should be taken into account when choosing the instrument.

### NIRISS

### MIRI
[MIRI info](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/miri.html)

The MIRI covers the wavelenght range from 5 to 28 microns. It is made for medium resolution spectography in this range.
