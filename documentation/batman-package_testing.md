# Testing the impact of parameters on light curve

### Specific effects, no limb darkening
(inc) Inclination needs to be very close to 90 to be able to see anything, it also impacts the steepness of the drop in brightness
(rp) Larger orbiting objects make a deeper drop in relative flux.
(a) the closer the planet the broader the bottom part of the spectrum
(e) the eccentricity effects the shape of the incoming part of the orbit (t_T - t_F)
(w) on its own does not seem to make visible changes. Combined with an eccentricity however, a higher value corresponds to a more rounded curve. 

### Effects of limb darkening methods
Limb darkening overview uses the values for c1 and c2 found in the link at the top of this document.

It turns the transit from a rectangle to a parabolic shape depending on the method used.
