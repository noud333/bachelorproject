# Logbook bachelor project Noud Hover

## Week 1 4-4-2022
### Initial plan:
Work with batman package on python to create transit light curves. Start with 0 limb darkening, and play with limb darkening, impact parameter, inclination ect to see how it effects expected light curves. See how the transit curve is changed based on the 5 parameters from the paper as well as changing the assumed parameters.

### Week 1 results
Batman package is working.
Created a large number of plots using batman, with different initial conditions and LD forms.
Working on installing pandexo, ran into custom error

## Week 2 11-4-2022
Finish installing pandexo, discuss end game plans, read up on emission lightcurves.

### Week 2, end game plans
Simulate systems in which young planets are found around the stars. In these systems, look at the emission spectrum during the 2nd transit to see whether or not the JWST observations will be create small enough errors to do usefull science on these systems. First system to look at will be V1298 Tau. 

### Week 2, plan
Together with looking into these emission spectra, start working with Pandexo simulate a jupiter like planet moving around a sun like star. Change the equilibrium temperature between 500 and 3000 K in steps of 500 and plot the eclipse depth against the wavelenght. 

### Week 2 results
On monday, the Pandexo python package was finally finished.
