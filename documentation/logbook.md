## Week 1 4-4-2020
### Initial plan:
Work with batman package on python to create transit light curves. Start with 0 limb darkening, and play with limb darkening, impact parameter, inclination ect to see how it effects expected light curves. See how the transit curve is changed based on the 5 parameters from the paper as well as changing the assumed parameters.

### Week 1 results
